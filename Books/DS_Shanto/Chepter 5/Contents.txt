Hello, I am Tatinee Sarker. I have currently graduated from Institute of Information Technology, Jahangirnagar University. I am drawn to programming since first year. I have participated in several coding competitions back then. An enthusiastic and adaptable learner with a passion for exploring emerging technologies. I thrive on challenges and maintain a strong focus on efficiency and organization in my work. I find joy in solving problems, be it through tech competitions or meeting client demands.
I saw that this R&D institution leads the development of the future technologies for Samsung's products and services. As I have curiosity to learn and work on innovation, I found this job desirable.
